Overview
--------

This repository contains data, notes, and code from a network biology study
group which meets weekly at the University of Maryland, College Park.

The study group covers material from a range of sources and references will be 
cited in the context of the notes wherein they are used.

Much of the earlier material, hoewever, is based on text from an introductory
